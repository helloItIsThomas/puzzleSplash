NOTES
It is a bit wierd having puzzle and puzzle on the bottom corner.
Try to switch the puzzle and studio on the top and bottom. 

Lets get as close to the example as possible for the contact menu.

For mobile it should take over the width entirely.
Its ok if it obscures the thing in the background a bit.
Maybe it doesn't scale, it just has three discreet sizes. it will snap to the three screen sizes. mobile, tablet, desktop.
