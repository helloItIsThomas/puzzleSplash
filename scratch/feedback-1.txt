Implement working email service


UI:
- Slow down the loading type animation
– Remove the type animation when the form opens
– Remove the hover animation from the links
– Use the X icon from the figma instead of the character ‘x’.
– SEND text should go black on rollover.

Box element:
– Swap PUZZLE and STUDIO on the outer top and bottom sides.
– Can we slow the spin to say 65% (or something like that) of what it is.
– RE the lighting and shading. Is there any way to get closer to what the visualiser did? He had a lovely sense of light, where even the blue was being reflected on the box.
