it still feels a bit big
if we can make it look like 80% zoom on chrome.

on mobile, the font size feels ok.
The x button should be smaller.
The white space on the entry fields on mobile feels big.

On desktop the messages field could be a bit smaller and the space allocated to the padding before and after the Customer Services. Maybe taking off 10 - 15 % of the text message box.


ANIMATION


The previous animation is closer,
make it like this but with the proper construction.
If the old one was timed nicer would be good.
The order for the old animation is pretty good actually.
Just make it look like the old animation and change the sizing and the rest of the above.

ASCII TOOL
Fix the color blue for the ascii tool.
The other thing is when downloading video, when you play the video back, it's very jittery.
